I’m an aspiring Data Engineer, learning hands-on while working full-time.
Since January 2025, I’ve been committed to learning by doing — building projects, writing code, and studying the fundamentals through DataCamp courses.

In April, I began pushing my projects to GitHub. I’m currently working on insightful ETL pipelines, alongside smaller repositories where I practice Python, PostgreSQL, and Docker.

I bring a unique path. For nine years, I lived in a monastery, immersed in Philosophy, Theology, Classical languages, deep reflection, and prayer. That formation taught me discipline, clarity of thought, and a love for order — strengths I now bring into the world of data.

Today, I work as a Purchases Operations Specialist in a wholesale-retail industrial supply company. There, I’ve seen firsthand how the absence of clean, accessible data slows down — and sometimes blocks — key decisions. That sparked my transition into Data Engineering: to create systems that make data more available and truly useful for business.

One quote has guided me through this journey:

"Omnia disce, videbis postea nihil esse superfluum."
"Learn everything; you will see later that nothing is superfluous."
— Hugh of Saint Victor, Didascalicon III.4
