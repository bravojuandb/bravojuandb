## Hello, I’m Juan.

I’m transitioning into Data Engineering — currently building real-world data pipelines and strengthening my Python and SQL skills, while also exploring AWS S3.

My main project is the [Classic Book ETL Pipeline](https://github.com/juan-dbravo/classicbook-etl-pipeline)  , where I extract, clean, and load structured text data into PostgreSQL. I’m also practicing daily Python drills and building workflow automation with Docker and GitHub Actions.

Next, I’m focusing on **cloud migration systems**, aiming to specialize in scalable, production-grade pipelines.

### Ongoing Learning

I'm actively building core skills through [DataCamp’s](https://www.datacamp.com/portfolio/bravojuandb) structured tracks, focusing on:

- Python & SQL fluency
- ETL pipelines
- Cloud foundations (AWS)
- Workflow automation
