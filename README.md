ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m Juan.

Iâ€™m transitioning into Data Engineering â€” currently building real-world data pipelines and sharpening my Python and SQL skills.

My main project is the **ClassicBook ETL Pipeline**, where I extract, clean, and load structured text data into PostgreSQL. Iâ€™m also building daily Python drills and exploring workflow automation with Docker and GitHub Actions.

Next, Iâ€™m focusing on **cloud migration systems**, aiming to specialize in scalable, production-ready pipelines.
