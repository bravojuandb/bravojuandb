## Hello, I’m Juan.

I build **data pipelines and data-processing artifacts** in Python and SQL, with a focus on deterministic behavior, explicit data contracts, and analytics-ready outputs.

## Shipped Pipelines

- **Navarra Economic Establishments – Batch ETL**
  - Deterministic batch pipeline that cleans and validates public administrative data
  - Enforces schema, null semantics, and identifier handling
  - Outputs analytics-ready Parquet
