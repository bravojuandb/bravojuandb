👋 Hello, I’m Juan.

I’m transitioning into Data Engineering — currently building real-world data pipelines and strengthening my Python and SQL skills, while also exploring AWS S3.

My main project is the **ClassicBook ETL Pipeline**, where I extract, clean, and load structured text data into PostgreSQL. I’m also practicing daily Python drills and building workflow automation with Docker and GitHub Actions.

Next, I’m focusing on **cloud migration systems**, aiming to specialize in scalable, production-grade pipelines.
